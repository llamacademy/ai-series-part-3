**IMMEDIATELY AFTER CHECKING THIS OUT** IMPORT THE [UNITY CHAN MODEL](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/unity-chan-model-18705) FROM THE UNITY ASSET STORE or you will be missing the model! (it's free)

In this project we have:
1. Simple click to move.
2. An enemy that follows the player
3. NavMeshLinks to allow the player and enemy to jump from one platform to another, and on top of some walls.
4. AgentLinkMover to control how NavMeshAgents will traverse NavMeshLinks
5. Animated 3D Model based on NavMeshAgent's movement
